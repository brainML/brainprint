preprocessing.ipynb: code for preprocessing FST data using mne. For other datasets, the preprocessing pipeline can be found in the Methods section and Supplementary Information A. Public datasets (HCP, MEG-EEG) have already been preprocessed.
featurization.ipynb: functions to create the three features (sp, tp, fq) for the FST, HCP, and MEG/EEG (tp & fq only) datasets. We omitt the code for SEN because it is identical to that of FST.
figures,ipynb: code for making the major figures in the manuscirpt. Omitting the code for SEN since it is identical to that of FST and the dataset has not been made public.

Any question can be sent to shenghao@cmu.edu.
